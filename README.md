## Prompt to help generate more puns and add to this list using GitHub pull requests :)

```
please generate puns based on the content of https://puns.onefact.org and give me instructions on how to submit any of my favorite puns as a pull request to this file using my github account (and how to create one if i haven't!), all in the form of an interactive adventure starting from https://github.com/onefact/puns.onefact.org/blob/main/README.md 
```
